## Project Overview and Purpose


## Overview:
Our analysis revolves around data points like age, gender, physical measurements (height and weight), blood pressure readings (systolic and diastolic), cholesterol levels, glucose levels, and lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. Most significantly, it includes a critical indicator of the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease, offering a valuable opportunity to explore correlations and patterns that may assist in predicting cardiovascular health risks.

## Purpose:
Identify key factors contributing to cardiovascular diseases.
Understand the interplay between lifestyle choices and cardiovascular health.
Develop predictive models to assess the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
Create a model to predict hospital readmission using machine learning model on a healthcare dataset with these input features:
Objective: factual information;
Examination: results of medical examination;
Subjective: information given by the patient.

## Conclusion
With the scope of this project, the data we could find that was free and accessible was what we used. A lot of the limitations could be resolved with a more real world data set. A lot fo the data was hidden behind paywalls or privacy barriers since it is patient data. If we were to do this, we could implement this real time. This could be an extra tool the hospital could use to further patient care and lower the cost of readmission.
